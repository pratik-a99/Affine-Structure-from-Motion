# Affine-Structure-from-Motion

This repository contains the code and output for the assignment 3 of the Computer Vision course. The assignment is divided into two parts

1. Epipolar Geometry

2. Affine Structure from Motion

Each part has its own folder containing the necessary data and code to run the algorithms. The code is written in Python and the Jupyter Notebook format (.ipynb) is used to present the code and results
